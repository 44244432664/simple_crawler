Project to download and make comic from 2 sites that lncrawler has not crawl yet: Truyenqq and Wikidich (also works for Wattpad at the current time since Wikidich is kind of copy Wattpad, just change the name and color). Yes, I know, I can just create a bot in lncrawl for Wikidich, but the thing is, I am stupid, so I have to do the hard way :>>>.
- To use terminal interface, just run the 

```python main.py```

Yes, it is goes through a lot of if else, I will try to make it better if I still remember about it and/or have time in the future. Now I'm just gonna lie down before continue learning, I've neglected it for too long to feel like I'm doing sth useful :'>

\* If you need an emergency project to store the comics or novels that you love which might be gone in some near future and you do not have the money to buy the whole comic or the country just does not import the comic, hope you enjoy this project before finding a better one :3

- <u>Note</u>: I will add the cbz to pdf converter for the ones who change their mind after having downloaded the manhua/manhwa in the cbz format (like me, yes, I felt very stupid after doing that) soon :>
